 * [ QUESTION ] : Do the two threads together always retrieve all the elements of the queue?

/* [ ANSWER ] : No, they don't.
 *
 * POSSIBLE OUTPUT:
 * [ A ] front 0 | new front 2
 * [ B ] front 0 | new front 1
 * [ .... ]
 *
 * As you can see thread B reads 0 and pops 0 (new front is 1), but thread A reads 0 and pops 1 (new front is 2).
 * 1 is deleted, but never retrieved.
