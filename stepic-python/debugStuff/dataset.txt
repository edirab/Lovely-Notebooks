The workers who are under the â€œcopper collarâ€ are referred to as â€œsnakesâ€ and the Anaconda Company is referred to as an â€œogreâ€.
Introduced in 1990, the Colt Anaconda is a large frame double-action revolver featuring a full length under-barrel ejection-rod lug and six round cylinder, designed and produced by the Colt's Manufacturing Company.
There were 2000 Kodiaks made as a special run of Anacondas, breaking away from their long history of naming revolvers after snakes.
There was an uncataloged 5" barrel version of the Anaconda, with reportedly less than 150 made.
The trigger actions on these guns are rated as very high-quality, and the heavy-duty solid construction and weight tends to absorb recoil, making the Anaconda relatively easy to shoot with heavy loads.
